Given an array of non-negative integers, A, of length N, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.\
\
Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.\
\
Return the minimum number of jumps required to reach the last index.\
\
If it is not possible to reach the last index, return -1.\
